## Project Decription 
	This is a 2d tower defence like shooter, created using the Godot 4.2/4.3 Engine.
	this is a mini game I plan to put into my next game as an easter egg!


## Assets and Textures
	I am no artist! so thankfully there are plenty of free art assets available. these asset are available for free (or donation). all assets aside from the ones listed bellow, where created by me.
### Asset Links:
- [Character Sprites](https://zerie.itch.io/tiny-rpg-character-asset-pack)
- [TileMap](https://pixel-poem.itch.io/dungeon-assetpuck)
- [Fonts](https://vrtxrry.itch.io/dungeonfont)

## Tech Stack 
#### all of the software used to plan and create this game. And how I used them 
1. [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
	- A Free game engine for 3d and 2d games.
	- relatively easy to use with lots of documentation, and video turtorials via [Godot Docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/index.html) 
2. [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
	- the code editor used in cs50, the editor im most used to
3. [GitHub](https://github.com/)
	- I didnt necessarily need to use a version control system but, having the ability to pull up old commits and revert back after breaking things is a life saver!
4. [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/)
	- free art program i used for creating pixel art. gimp is slept on fr fr
5. [Notion](https://www.notion.so/desktop)
	- it has the ability not only to track a ticket system, but you can link directly to Github.
	- Notion has support for creating imbedded code blocks. i used this feature to work on scripts on my phone while at work or on the go

### here is link to my [todo](https://productive-payment-f43.notion.site/Main-TODOS-23418035171544fe9589af9c6306190e?pvs=4https://productive-payment-f43.notion.site/Main-TODOS-23418035171544fe9589af9c6306190e?pvs=4) tag system  
6. [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
	- personally i think copilot is terrible. i learned more from just reading documentation and trying and failing.
	- copilot made many mistakes. therefore i stopped using it completely .
7. [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/?ref=dotcom)
	- first thingis chatgpt is only trained on godots 4.2 release. so the answers given are usually wrong now.
	- I used gpt to explain concepts,not to produce code  
		#### examples: 
		>explain how a state machine works

		> what is OOP? and how is it used in game dev

### Wheres the game?!?

you can download the game exe file from...

## About The game
	attack of the orcs is a tower defence shooter.
	there is only one goal, defend your castle aganst
	an unslaught of of orc invaders! 
	each round weighs heavy on your shoulders as the orcs 
	gain in strength and numbers.
	utilize drops to boost your abilitys.
	DEFEND THE BARRIER WITH YOUR LIFE!



### The journey
	I decided to live stream the majority of this games creation. A decision made too late unfortunatly, 
	i missed a decent bunch of the beginning.

	The idea came from an old web game called The Last Stand, however i did not copy the game!

	The easy part was creating the map and menu systems.
	there was a major update to Godot during this process
	so i had to adapt. 
	creating UI scenes in Godot is very similar to CSS and html.
	Godot uses "containers" which cam contain containers the rely on the parent containers


	The Game itself started out easy enough to create, there 
	is a plethra of videos on youtube for beginner 
	script tutorials amongst other helpfull topics.
	however the godot Docs proved to be the best route for info.
	
	The parts I struggled with most was understanding state machines and timer logic.
	And much of my code became spagheti quick.
	Honestly most of my time was spent debugging my own mistakes but I persist.

	also creating a multi sort, multi array boost spawner was probably the hardest part of this whole game find it in enemy.gd .

## About Me
	My name is morgan or Moe and im just a normal guy, single dad construction worker, the only reason i stumbled into programming and game dev was because of piratesoftware on youtube. taking CS50 was one of the biggest challenges ive ever put myself through.
	I hope to one day make a full fledged indy game and publish it to steam.
