	This is a 2d game, where you defend your fortress from waves of orc invaders. shoot them down with your bow and gain points towards your highscore. Pickup power boosts to help last longer in the enslaught.

## Tech Stack 
	all of the software used to plan and create this game. And how I used them 
1. [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
	- A Free game engine for 3d and 2d games.
	- relatively easy to use with lots of documentation, and video turtorials via [Godot Docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/index.html) 
2. [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
	- the code editor used in cs50, the editor im most used to
3. [GitHub](https://github.com/)
	- I didnt necessarily need to use a version control system but, having the ability to pull up old commits and revert back after breaking things is a life saver!
4. [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/)
	- free art program i used for creating pixel art. gimp is slept on fr fr
5. [Notion](https://www.notion.so/desktop)
	- I used notion to develope a game design document.
	- it has the ability not only to track a ticket system, but you can link directly to Github.
	- Notion has support for creating imbedded code blocks. i used this feature to work on scripts on my phone while at work or on the go 
6. [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
	- personally i think copilot is terrible. i learned more from just reading documentation and trying and failing.
	- copilot made many mistakes. therefore i stopped using it completely .
7. [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/?ref=dotcom)
	- first thingis chatgpt is only trained on godots 4.2 release. so the answers given are usually wrong now.
	- I used gpt to explain concepts,not to produce code
